# Computers

## There are 4 things are common to all computers

1. Input
2. Storage
3. Processing
4. Output

And that’s what’s make a computer a computer

Computers started out as a basic calculators, but now we can use them for too many things like playing games or even controlling robots.

* Types of input: keyboard, mouse, microphone… etc.

And that’s how we deal with computers, so if you to tell a computer to inserts a letter all you have to is pressing that letter.

For the storage and the processing part all these different inputs gives the computer the information which is stored in the memory.
And for the processing part the processor takes the required information form the memory   to change it using a series of commands and then the information will be send back to the memory.

* The output: it can be like text, photos, videos, games or even a virtual reality.
* Once the computer is connected to the internet the output of that computer will be an input to the other one.

## Binary & Data

Ones and zeroes do play a big role in how computer work but on the inside.

The state of a single wire is called a BIT, such as the (on off) state of this wire (BIT), and it’s the smallest information that the computer can save.

In the decimal number system we have 10 digits which are (0 – 9) but in the binary system we have only two digits which are (0 & 1).

* Numbers, sound, image all can display whit the binary system.

## Circuits and Logic

A simple circuits takes an eclectic signal and flips it, so if the signal you give it is a one then the circuit will give you a zero.

* To do a complicated 3D graphics or record a high full HD movie you need a computer with a multiple CPU to process all that information and many GB of memory to store it.

## Hardware and Software

Once you look inside a computer you will see a lot such as:
Circuit, chips, wires, speakers, plugs and stuff then you are looking to the hardware itself.

Software is all the computers program or codes running on this machine and this is the part that you won’t see.

Operating system: is the master program that manages how software uses the hard ware of a computer.
