## A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.
### the most important features that should be in any text editor is:
1. code completion 
2. syntax highlighting 
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue) 
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available.

we have too many text editor software such as:
* NotePad++ ,TextWrangler/BB Edit and Visual Studio Code and each one of them has his own features.

* The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs:
1. A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the titleâ€”it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files.

2. IDE is stand for (Integrated Development Environment): is really a suite of different software all coming together

### command shortcuts:
pwd which stands for Print Working Directory
ls It's short for list. it shows the files and folders at the target one.
cd Change Directories
touch to create a file ends with extension
mkdic to create a folder 

### extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. such as:
file.exe - an executable file, or program.
file.txt - a plain text file.
file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

#### here is a new shortcut which is ls -a and it stands for List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
