# JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.

## How JAVASCRIPT makes web pages more interactive?

* access content: you can use javascript to select any element or text from an HTML page.
* modify content: you can add elements or text to the page or remove them.
* program rules: you can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow which allows it to access or change the content of the page.

## what is a  SCRIPT and how to do one?

* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

## EXPRESSIONS

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

## OPERATORS

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS Assign a value to a variable
2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS Perform basic math
3. STRING OPERATORS Combine two strings such as: greeting
4. COMPARISON OPERATORS Compare two values and return true or false

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
